# Write a function `divisible_by_three_pair_sum(array)` that takes an array of numbers. It should return an array of all the pairs of indices, whose elements sum to a multiple of three.

def divisible_by_three_pair_sum(array) 


end 


# Examples:
p divisible_by_three_pair_sum([1, 6, 3, 4, 2, 0]) == [[0, 4], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4]]

p divisible_by_three_pair_sum([8, 3, 5, 9, 2]) == [[1, 3]]
