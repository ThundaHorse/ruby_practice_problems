# Write a function `max_adjacent_sum(array)` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the maximum sum of adjacent numbers in the array.

# HINT: First think how we can find adjacent elements in an array!

def max_adjacent_sum(array) 


end 


# Examples:

array_1 = [5, 6, 11, 3]
max_adjacent_sum(arr1) == 17

array_2 = [3, 2, 13, 5, 4, 7]
max_adjacent_sum(arr2) == 18
