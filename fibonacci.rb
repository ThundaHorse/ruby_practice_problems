# Write a function fibonacci(n) that takes in a number that
# represents the length of a sequence. The function should
# should return the first `n` numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

# The first two numbers of the fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1.
# The next number in the sequence can be found by adding the
# last two numbers in the sequence.

# Examples:

# fibonacci(0) == []
# fibonacci(1) == [ 1 ]
# fibonacci(2) == [ 1, 1 ]
# fibonacci(3) == [ 1, 1, 2 ]
# fibonacci(5) == [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ]
# fibonacci(10) == [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ]
