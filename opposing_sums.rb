# Write a function `opposing_sums(array)` that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing half the number of elements. Assume the `array` contains an even number of elements.

# The first element of the new array should be the sum between the 1st and last element of the original `array`. The second element of the new array should be the sum between the 2nd and 2nd to last element. The third element
# of the new array should be the sum between the 3rd and 3rd to last element
# ... etc.

def opposing_sums(array)

end 

# Examples:

array_1 = [3, 2, 11, 4, 7, 9]
p opposing_sums(array_1) == [ 12, 9, 15 ]

array_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4
p opposing_sums(array_2) == [ 5, 5 ]
