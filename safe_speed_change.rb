# Write a function safe_speed_change?(speeds) that takes in an array of speed numbers. The function should return true if consecutive speeds in the array differ by no more than 5, false otherwise.

# Examples:

# safe_speed_change?([3, 3, 2, 6, 8, 7])
# safe_speed_change?([3, 3, 2, 6, 12, 10])
# safe_speed_change?([8, 10, 4, 3, 2])
