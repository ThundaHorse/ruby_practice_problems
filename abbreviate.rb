# Write a function `abbreviate(sentence)` that takes in a sentence string and returns a new sentence where words longer than 4 characters have their vowels removed. Assume the sentence has all lowercase characters.
# Feel free to use the array below in your solution:

# vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

# Examples:
# abbreviate('bootcamp is fun') == 'btcmp is fun'
# abbreviate('programming is fantastic') == 'prgrmmng is fntstc'
# abbreviate('hello world') == 'hll wrld'
# abbreviate('how are you') == 'how are you'
